# CONTRIBUTING

## Contributing with Changesets

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/) to manage versioning and changelogs for our packages. This ensures consistent version bumps and automatic changelog generation.

When you created changes on a branch please run changesets to trigger a new version or update the changelog:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select the packages affected by your changes.
2. Choose a bump type:

- `patch` → bug fixes, small improvements
- `minor` → new features, backwards-compatible
- `major` → breaking changes

3. Add a summary describing your changes.

After completion, a markdown file will be created in .changeset/ (e.g., red-fox.md).
Commit these together with your changes. The publishing will be done manually by the maintainers when merged.
