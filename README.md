# Legit Monorepo

### Meet Legit SDK — fail-safe apps made simple.

Legit SDK is built around **two core ideas**: fail-safe by design, and effortlessly simple to use.

Fail-safe means giving your users the same superpowers you know from Git:

- Roll back to any previous state
- Branch off to run experiments safely
- Accept changes when you’re happy with the result

And it’s easy because you interact through the **file system API** (Legit FS) — the same one you learned in your first semesters of computer science.

**Runs everywhere.** Use Legit SDK as an API in the browser, or mount it as a folder on your machine. That means instant compatibility with the stack of your choice: Node.js, Python, Java… you name it.

async function main() {
  const legitFs = await initLegitFs(fs, '/');

  await legitFs.promises.writeFile(
    '/.legit/branches/main/hello.txt',
    'Hello world'
  );

  const history = await legitFs.promises.readFile(
    '/.legit/branches/main/.legit/history',
    'utf8'
  );
  console.log(content);
}
main();
```
