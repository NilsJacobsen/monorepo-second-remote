# @legit-sdk/core

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 8280e67: **Archive loading enhancements:**
  - Added a `clearExisting` option to the `loadArchive` method in `openLegitFs`, allowing the entire `.git` folder to be cleared before loading an archive. This ensures that loading an archive can fully replace the repository state if desired.
  - Updated the archive loading logic to accept a parameter object instead of a bare archive, and modified all relevant tests to use the new API.
  - Added a comprehensive test verifying that `loadArchive` with `clearExisting: true` fully replaces the repository, removing all prior refs and content.

  **Git branch and ref resolution improvements:**
  - Refactored branch and ref resolution in Git virtual file adapters to use a new `tryResolveRef` utility, reducing duplicated error handling and improving robustness when resolving refs
  - Improved error messages and logic when operation branches or base branches do not exist, making failures clearer and easier to debug.

  **Code quality and bug fixes:**
  - Fixed a bug in `PathRouter` where route parameters were incorrectly decoded, which could cause issues with certain URL patterns.
  - Added a guard in `CompositeSubFsAdapter` to handle cases where `storageFs` is not defined, preventing runtime errors for non-Git adapters.
  - Simplified the branches list adapter to avoid unnecessary async calls when listing branch directories.
  - Minor code cleanups and whitespace fixes in Git virtual file adapters.

  These changes collectively improve reliability, test coverage, and maintainability of the composite filesystem's Git integration.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b1be8e: New Features
  - Archive & Restore Functionality
    - Added saveArchive() method - Creates a compressed portable archive of the entire Legit repository (.git folder)
      - Recursively captures all Git objects, refs, and configuration
      - Encodes binary content as base64 in a JSON manifest

    - Added loadArchive() method - Restores a Legit repository from a previously created archive
      - Decompresses and parses the archive manifest
      - Intelligently handles Git references to prevent data loss: - New refs → Added directly to repository
        - Fast-forwardable refs → Updated to new commit
        - Conflicting refs → Created as {branch}-conflict-{uuid} to preserve both versions
      - Skips config files to avoid overriding user-specific settings
      - Safely merges archive data with existing repository state
  - Use Cases
    - Backup & Restore: Complete repository snapshots for disaster recovery
    - Repository Sharing: Transfer repositories between systems without network sync
    - Offline Distribution: Bundle repositories with applications or documentation

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- This pull request introduces several enhancements and refactorings to the composite filesystem (CompositeFs) architecture, focusing on improving modularity, context-awareness, and extensibility for sub-filesystems (SubFS). The most significant changes include the introduction of operation context propagation, new interfaces for filtering directory entries, and a major refactor of SubFS base classes and adapters. Additionally, it adds configuration and setup for a new CLI tool example and makes some minor cleanup changes.
