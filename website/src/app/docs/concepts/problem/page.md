title: The Problem - Why AI Needs Versioning, Boundaries, and Audit Trails
description: AI today suggests, not changes - because real collaboration needs accountability, safety, boundaries, and coordination. Here’s the problem Legit solves.

# The Problem

Until now, AI has only produced suggestions, not changes.
It drafts an email, rewrites a paragraph, summarizes a meeting — but it’s still the human who applies the result. We copy, paste, and move things back into Outlook or Google Docs ourselves.

Technically, AI could already act as a true collaborator. Thousands of automation frameworks and “agent” protocols exist today. Yet adoption remains minimal. 

**Why?** Because real collaboration brings a cascade of problems that today’s infrastructure simply isn’t built to handle.

### Real collaboration demands more than good models:

- **Accountability:** Every change must be auditable. (who did what, when, and why)
- **Safety:** Changes can be harmful. We need sandboxing, review, and rollback.
- **Boundaries:** Agents must respect privacy, security, and compliance constraints.
- **Coordination:** Multiple agents can conflict. Race conditions, duplicate work, and competing goals are inevitable.

Until these issues are solved, AI will remain on the sidelines — suggesting, not doing.
