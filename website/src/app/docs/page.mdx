# Meet Legit SDK 

Legit SDK is a Git-backed filesystem API that lets you build versioned, fail-safe applications with automatic commit history—no Git knowledge required.

## How Legit Works with the Filesystem API

**Everything is based on the filesystem API.** If you know how to read and write files, you already know how to use Legit SDK.

The core operations are simple:
- **Read files** - `readFile()` to access current or historical versions
- **Write files** - `writeFile()` to create or update files (automatically creates commits)
- **Create directories** - `mkdir()` to set up branches and organize files

That's it. No special Git commands, no complex APIs. Just the filesystem operations you already know.

```typescript
// Read a file
const content = await legitFs.promises.readFile('/.legit/branches/main/document.txt', 'utf8')

// Write a file (automatically creates a commit)
await legitFs.promises.writeFile('/.legit/branches/main/document.txt', 'Hello World', 'utf8')

// Create a directory (e.g., a new branch)
await legitFs.promises.mkdir('/.legit/branches/feature-xyz')
```

**New to filesystem APIs?** The concepts are universal—if you've worked with files in any language, you'll feel at home. The filesystem API is the same interface you learned in your first programming courses.

Need a refresher on working with files? Check out [W3Schools: Node.js File System](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_filesystem.asp) or similar beginner resources to get started.

## Why Legit SDK?

Legit SDK is built around three core ideas: **fail-safe** by design, **effortlessly simple** to use, and **100% Git compatible**.

**Fail-safe** means giving your users the same superpowers you know from Git:
- Roll back to any previous state
- Branch off to run experiments with AI safely
- Merge changes back when you're happy with the result

**Runs everywhere.** Use Legit SDK as an API in the browser, Node.js, or mount it as a folder on your machine. That means instant compatibility with the stack of your choice — Python, Java, Node.js… you name it — from day one.

**100% Git compatible.** Legit SDK creates standard Git repositories under the hood. That means the entire Git ecosystem works with your Legit projects from day one.<br/>
GitHub, GitLab, CI/CD pipelines, Git GUIs, and all your existing Git tools. You can even open a Legit repository with standard Git commands if you need to. No lock-in, no proprietary formats—just Git.
